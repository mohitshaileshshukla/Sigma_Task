## Customer Segmentation Dashboard

The Customer Segmentation Dashboard allows users to analyze and visualize customer segments. The app uses clustering algorithms (KMeans) to identify distinct customer groups, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and business strategies.

**About the APP**

1. The app automatically loads the dataset (`Customer_Segmentation_Dataset.csv`).
2. It performs basic cleaning tasks like handling missing values and creating new features (e.g., Age, Total Spending, and Children).
3. The app uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into k clusters
4. Users can adjust the number of clusters (k) through an interactive slider in the sidebar.
5. PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the clusters in a 2D space.
6. Displays numeric averages for each cluster across various features (e.g., Age, Income, Total Spending, Children).
7. Shows the number of customers in each cluster.
8. Displays feature distributions (e.g., Age, Total Spending) by cluster to identify unique patterns.
